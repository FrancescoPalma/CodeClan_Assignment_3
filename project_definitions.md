#Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

##Magic 8 Ball

Goal: Practice what we have learned in the Java / Android weeks

####MVP
You are required to write an app which allows the user to input any question, and receive an answer from the Magic 8 Ball. You will have to create a stock of answers and store them somewhere. When the user asks a questions the app needs to randomly get an answer from the list and display it to the user.

###Extensions

* Keep a list of previous questions and answers. 
* Have an admin feature to add new answers. 
* Add animations and graphics i.e. make it look cool and snazzy :-)
* If you’re feeling really ambitious, add a feature to ‘shake’ the ball.

##Underwater Exploration

Goal: Practice what we learned in the Java / Android weeks and research how to make a game. (research heavy)

Based on the popular video game Flappy Bird, design and implement a game that allows you to play as either a diver or fish to swim underwater, avoiding obstacles to reach their destination.

User presses up arrow or space bar (or tap screen in Android) to make diver or fish swim upwards. The diver or fish sinks toward the bottom between keypresses.

###Project Extensions:

* Diver must resurface for air before oxygen supply runs out
* Fish must avoid sharks and eat algae to score extra points

##Food Tracker

Goal: Practice OO and UI design with what we learned in Java / Android weeks 

You are required to write an application that allows a user to track the food they eat. Users should be able to enter what they eat and when (date/time) and for what meal. 

The app should show the user a record of what they have eaten over a given period e.g. In March I drank lots of Irn-Bru.

##Fantasy Zoo Manager

Goal: Practice OO modelling  in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our dragons, unicorns and other mystical beings. The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!

###Additionally:
 
* Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other. 
* Animal babies can be sold(!) to other zoos :/
* Visitors can enter / exit the zoo if there are tickets left. 
* View the total income for the zoo.
* Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures

##Chocolate Factory

You have been asked by a suspicious man called Willy Wonka to model his chocolate factory.

You must have a factory that produces chocolate bars. Each chocolate bar has a chance of containing one of the 5 golden tickets. The user can visit the factory if they have a golden ticket.

The factory also produces sweets which must have effects - some might make you get bigger, turn blue, explode etc.
