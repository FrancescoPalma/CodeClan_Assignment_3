This is my second Solo Project at CodeClan, Cohort3.  
We have to choose [_**one**_ among the following ideas](https://github.com/FrancescoPalma/CodeClan_Assignment_3/blob/master/project_definitions.md) and build an application according to the specs of the related project.  
I have chosen the **Underwater Exploration** game app in **Android** as I really want to build a game before finishing the course and I think the right time has finally come. This assignment comes after two weeks of classes on **Java** and the **Android** OS. We haven't covered anything about graphics and games, so this is really a 'wild' choice where one is free to truly experiment and flow with their own creativity.  
As soon as I heard the word 'wild' I said to myself, 'Go for it!'.  
I am not sure yet what the outcome would be but I want to make a working prototype and expand it step by step. I am keen to learn, experiment and welcome this challenge :sunglasses:  

**Time:** From Friday 29/04/16 to Thursday 05/05/16  
  
**Requirements for MVP:**  
Based on the popular video game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird), design and implement a game that allows you to play as either a diver or fish to swim underwater, avoiding obstacles to reach their destination.
User presses up arrow or space bar (or tap screen in Android) to make diver or fish swim upwards. The diver or fish sinks toward the bottom between keypresses. 
  
**Potential Further functionalities to build:**  
* Diver must resurface for air before oxygen supply runs out
* Fish must avoid sharks and eat algae to score extra points

#### Day 1  
Today I've been working on the planning of the app, drawing the screens and using the white board to think about the structure of the code, the assets for the game, the main functionalities.  
I've focused a lot on the story and the meaning of the game as I am always oriented in creating a meaningful UX of any software I build, even if it's small or just for educational purposes I still work on it as if it were something to deliver to a client. In this case the 'client' is the degree of happiness and commitment I feel while building it :)  
I found really beneficial to share thoughts with other coworkers who are going to build the same app.  
Can't wait to start tomorrow, I'm fired up! :fire:  
  
#### Day 2 - 3  
During the weekend I enjoyed spending some time off, especially Sunday afternoon. Nevertheless, I focused on the design of the game. I followed a few tutorials on how to structure a little android game - in this case how to create a 'Flappy Bird' clone - from design to code, from graphics to sprites and animations. I understand how much time it takes to create a complete game. I am currently spending a lot of time on searching for the 'Assets' such as fonts, pictures (make them 'responsive' by storing them in xxhdpi, xhdpi, hdpi, mdpi and ldpi extensions. So, in a few words, a lot of layout design, Photoshop and some Illustrator. Now the graphics and the UI are pretty clear in my head and I've almost everything ready for that. I've also set up the files and classes structure of the app itself in Java. After following tutorials I have a better idea of what it looks like to start building a game, not an easy business at all. But quite fun to be honest! Worth the time :) Ready to start Day 4!
