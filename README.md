This is my second Solo Project at CodeClan, Cohort3.  
We have to choose [_**one**_ among the following ideas](https://github.com/FrancescoPalma/CodeClan_Assignment_3/blob/master/project_definitions.md) and build an application according to the specs of the related project.  
I have chosen the **Underwater Exploration** game app in **Android** as I really want to build a game before finishing the course and I think the right time has finally come. This assignment comes after two weeks of classes on **Java** and the **Android** OS. We haven't covered anything about graphics and games, so this is really a 'wild' choice where one is free to truly experiment and flow with their own creativity.  
As soon as I heard the word 'wild' I said to myself, 'Go for it!'.  
I am not sure yet what the outcome would be but I want to make a working prototype and expand it step by step. I am keen to learn, experiment and welcome this challenge :sunglasses:  

**Time:** From Friday 29/04/16 to Thursday 05/05/16  
  
**Requirements for MVP:**  
Based on the popular video game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird), design and implement a game that allows you to play as either a diver or fish to swim underwater, avoiding obstacles to reach their destination.
User presses up arrow or space bar (or tap screen in Android) to make diver or fish swim upwards. The diver or fish sinks toward the bottom between keypresses. 
  
**Potential Further functionalities to build:**  
* Diver must resurface for air before oxygen supply runs out
* Fish must avoid sharks and eat algae to score extra points
